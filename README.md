# Metana-Swisstronik-Challenge
Check path:contracts/Mut.sol to see MUT contract(an ERC20 mintable token) and check under scripts to see deploy.js, getTotalSupply.js and mintMut.js to see scripts that deploys, get total supply and mint 100 MUT tokens respectively with instructions. Thanks

Note: run npm install to install dependencies and create .env file to specify your wallet privateKey in order to interact with the scripts.

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
